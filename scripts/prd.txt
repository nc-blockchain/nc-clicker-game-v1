# Product Requirements Document: Token Clicker Gameplay Improvements

## Overview
Improve UX and consistency: align Bounties TO CLAIM with Boosts design, keep MY CLAIMED as colored bird cards, centralize settings on Wallet, simplify Friends page, and improve PVP leaderboard visibility.

## Requirements

### 1. Settings on Wallet Tab
- All game settings live on the Wallet tab.
- Add a SETTINGS section or button on the Wallet page that opens profile/game settings.
- Profile name is editable only in Wallet → Settings (not on Friends).

### 2. Friends Page
- Remove the PROFILE block (your name + CHANGE NAME) from the Friends page; name is managed in Wallet → Settings only.
- Move PVP Duel Wins to the top of the Friends page.
- Display PVP Duel Wins as a list (same style as current, but at top).
- Add a button (e.g. "VIEW FULL LIST") that opens a popup/modal showing the full PVP leaderboard list.

### 3. Bounties – TO CLAIM
- Match the design of the Boosts section: vertical list of gray panels (bg-pixel-panel, border-2 border-gray-700, rounded, flex row with description left and CLAIM button right).
- No card grid on TO CLAIM; use a list layout consistent with Boosts.

### 4. Bounties – MY CLAIMED
- MY CLAIMED tab shows only colored square cards (bird cards) in a grid.
- Each card is a colored square corresponding to the bounty type (green, yellow, cyan, pink) with the bird image and bounty name/reward.

### 5. Testing
- Test core gameplay: tap to earn, claim bounties, view TO CLAIM vs MY CLAIMED.
- Test Wallet: balance, Settings (profile name).
- Test Friends: PVP list at top, full-list popup, no profile block.
- Test Boosts: buy flow and balance display.

## Out of Scope (for later)
- New gameplay mechanics (e.g. new bounties or boosts) unless specified elsewhere.
- Backend/Supabase schema changes for these UI-only changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wallet tab has a way to open Settings (profile name).
- [ ] Friends page has no profile/name block.
- [ ] PVP Duel Wins is at the top of Friends in a list; a button opens full list in a popup.
- [ ] TO CLAIM bounties look like Boosts (gray panel list).
- [ ] MY CLAIMED shows colored square bird cards in a grid.
- [ ] Manual test pass: home, boosts, bounties (both tabs), friends, wallet, settings.
